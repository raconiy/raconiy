## 🏀 Interests

- **🏀 Basketball** — Competitive player at shooting guard. Team dynamics and persistence on the court mirror how I approach collaborative research.
- **🎷 Saxophone** — Trained in jazz and classical repertoire; regular performance practice sharpens discipline and creative expression beyond code.
- **⚫ Weiqi** — Amateur 1-dan (2016) → 5-dan (current). Strategic depth and long-term planning in Weiqi align with rigorous research thinking.
- **🔬 Research** — Deep passion for pushing boundaries in MLLM, CV, and audio. Curiosity-driven exploration is what keeps me motivated.
